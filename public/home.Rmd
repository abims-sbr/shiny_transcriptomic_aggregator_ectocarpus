## Introduction
---

Shiny Transcriptomic Aggregator is a web-based application designed to explore RNA-seq data.
 The default dataset made available here is a collection of samples for the model brown alga Ectocarpus but the application can be run with any RNA-seq dataset provided using the "import new data" function.

The application consists of several tabs allowing users to easily import, analyze, visualize and explore RNA Seq data.

Some examples of Shiny Transcriptomic Aggregator graphic output are
