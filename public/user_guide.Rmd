## Table
---

The table is the main part of Shiny Transcriptomic Aggregator.

It is used to analyze, visualize, explore and filter RNA Seq data.

It consists in two collapsible filter panel, one for samples metadata and one for genes metadata, a collapsible sample list and the table. Both filter panels and the sample list allow to display a subset of the table according to the filters chosen. 

The table is a dynamic overview of your data. Many features are provided such as searching, sorting or exporting for example.

Applying filters, clicking on the "Apply filters" button under the sample list will update the table.

**It is the data in the displayed table that are used to build plots**


## Charts
---

4 charts are available :

- Barplot

- Boxplot

- Dotplot (*WIP*)

- Heatmap

Use the Visualize button to preview the generated graph. It can then be downloaded in different formats.


## Import new data
---

By default, a set of ectocarpus data is already load. But you can import new files using the file browsers in the "Import data" tab.

TPM, genes and samples data file are required in this case and should be presented as follows :

- TPMs file (.csv)

	| gene_id*    | sample1   | sample2   | ... |
	| ----------- | --------- | ----------| --- |
	| (character) | (numeric) | (numeric) | ... |
	| gene1       | TPM       | TPM       | ... |
	| gene2       | TPM       | TPM       | ... |
	| ...         |  ...      | ...       | ... |

- Genes data file (.csv)

	| gene_id*    | gene_metadata_1 | gene_metadata_2 | ... |
	| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | --- |
	| (character) | (character)     | (character)     | ... |
	| gene1       | value           | value           | ... |
	| gene2       | value           | value           | ... |
	| ...         |  ...            | ...             | ... |

- Samples data file (.csv)

	| sample_id*  | sample_name | private   | sample_metadata_1 | sample_metadata_2 | ... |
	| ------------| ----------- | --------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --- |
	| (character) | (character) | (boolean) | (character)       | (character)       | ... |
	| sample1     | name        | TRUE      | value             | value             | ... |
	| sample2     | name        | FALSE     | value             | value             | ... |
	| ...         |  ...        | ...       | ...               | ...               | ... |

*(&ast;) gene_id and sample_id should be unique*
